# DSA-Solutions (C++)

**Hi, I'm Soumya!👋
This repository documents my practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **C++**.
It reflects my learning journey, problem-solving approach, and preparation for technical interviews and various contests.

---

## 🌱 Why this repository exists

I believe good problem-solving is less about memorizing patterns and more about:
- understanding **why** a solution works  
- choosing **clarity over cleverness**  
- building fundamentals strong enough to scale  

This repository exists to support that belief.

Every problem here represents a moment of learning which is sometimes quick, sometimes frustrating, but always intentional.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is maintained to build strong problem solving skills, improve my logical thinking and practice commonly asked DSA problems and maintain a public record of consistency and growth.

---

## 🚀 How I plan to grow this space

This repository is a work in progress. Over time, I plan to:
- add more challenging problems  
- revisit old solutions and improve them  
- explore advanced topics once the basics feel natural  

Growth, for me, is iterative.
